A rare example of a Kadur civilian craft, the Mendicant is a sturdy little multipurpose shuttle/haulercraft built for in-system ferrying and short-hop hyperspace travel. Designed with military-grade thrusters and an extensive flare-based Active Defense System, the spec was once called grim - even paranoid - but in the tumultuous cycles since the Harrowing has come to stand as a symbol of Kadur hardiness and pragmatism, seeing service as a light blockade runner or second-string combat vessel almost as often as it used for its original role" property="og:description" />
