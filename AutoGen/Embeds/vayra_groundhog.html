A heavy utility frigate originally designed for high-risk resource extraction in dense asteroid fields and planetary debris, the Groundhog has surprising mobility for its mass thanks to a wide network of maneuvering thrusters. Heavily armored and boasting a military-grade flux core design, it is frequently lauded by independent mining captains as an excellent light freighter and salvage ship - one that poses at least as much of a deterrent to pirates as any escorts that might be deployed alongside it" property="og:description" />
