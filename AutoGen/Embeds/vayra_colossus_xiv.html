	<meta content="At first glance this modified Colossus freighter sporting Hegemony livery appears to be a militarized auxiliary, or perhaps even a surviving logistics vessel from the historic Fourteenth Battlegroup. Upon closer inspection however the ships disreputable provenance is clear: The stripes are haphazard, the paint faded, the exterior hull plating crudely welded in place - at least where it hasn't been cut away to provide room for jury-rigged weapon mounts - and to top it all off, somebody has painted 'NOT PIRATES' on one side of the hull and 'TECHNICALLY WE'RE PRIVATEERS' on the other in gigantic, clumsy block capitals" property="og:description" />
