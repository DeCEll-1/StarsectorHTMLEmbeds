	<meta content="This ship has been given Luddic Church markings. Systems modifications are otherwise superficial.

Occupying a comfortable place on the spectrum between ponderous, menacing heavy cruisers, sturdy carriers, and more agile but less well-defended lighter craft, the Oppressor is most commonly seen deployed in system defense fleets where its relative mobility, omnidirectional shield emitter, and ample light weapon arrays allow it to provide point defense cover and fighter support to Dominator-class line assault and artillery ships." property="og:description" />
